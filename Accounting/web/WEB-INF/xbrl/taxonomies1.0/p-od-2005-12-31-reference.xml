      <ref-corep:Comment>Number of events recorded by business line. If one event has an impact on several business lines it should be reported in all the business lines where the loss is over the relevant threshold. Also, in this case the total number of events in "Total Business Lines" and "Total event types" will be lower than the aggregation of the number of event by business lines since those events with multiple impacts will be considered as just one.</ref-corep:Comment>

In the case of the maximum single loss in "Total Event Types" and "Total business lines", those events with an impact on different business lines should be considered as a single one and, accordingly, the maximum single loss in that element may be higher than the higher of the maximum single losses by business lines.</ref-corep:Comment>
